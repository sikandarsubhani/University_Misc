What is Polymorphism in C++ ?
The word polymorphism means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.

Virtual Function
A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword virtual. 
Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we donâ€™t want static linkage for this function.
